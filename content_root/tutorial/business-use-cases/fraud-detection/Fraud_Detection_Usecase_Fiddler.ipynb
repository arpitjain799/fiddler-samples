    "Undetected Fraud Cases can lead to losses for company and customers, not to mention damage reputation and relationship with customers. Fiddler’s MPM platforms can be used to identify the pitfalls in your ML model and mitigate them before they have an impact on your business.\n",
    "In this walkthrough we investigated one such issue with a fraud detection model where a data integrity issue caused performance of the ML model to drop. \n",
    "Fiddler can be used to keep the health of your Fraud Detection Model up by - \n",

    "1.   Monitoring the drift of the performance metric\n",
    "2.   Monitoring various performance metrics associated with the model\n",
    "3.   Monitoring data integrity issues which could harm the model performance\n",
    "4.   Investigating the features which have drifted/ compromised and analyzing them to mitigate the issue\n",
    "5.   Performing a Root Cause Analysis to identify the exact cause and fixing it\n",
    "6.   Diving into point explanations to identify how much the issue has an impact on a particular data point\n",
    "7.   Setting up alerts to make sure the issue does not happen again\n",

    "We discovered there was an issue with the ‘Category’ column, wherein a new value was discovered in the production data. This led to performance drop in the data likely due to the range violation. We suggest two steps to mitigate this issue-\n",

    "1.   Setting up an ‘alerts’ to identify similar issues in data integrity\n",
    "2.   Retraining the ML model after including the new data (with the ground truth labels) to teach the model of the new values\n",
