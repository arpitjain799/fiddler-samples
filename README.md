# Getting Started

This package contains tutorials, samples, and documentation for using Fiddler.

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:

   ```git clone https://github.com/fiddler-labs/fiddler-samples.git```

2. Build notebook server
   
   Prerequisite: 
   
      Docker - min. Docker EE 18.09 or CE 17.12.1 installed and running.

   ```cd fiddler-samples; make build``` 

3. Start noteboook server

   ```make run```

4. Notebook service is now running at http://localhost:7100

5. To try out the tutorial you will also need Fiddler server. You can either get a cloud account or download Fiddler Onebox from a link that will be emailed to you
   
6. Configure fiddler client:

   Login to fiddler account and copy auth token from Settings > Credentials > Key
   
   To update token and client URL visit: 

   content_root/tutorial/00 Install & Setup.ipynb

```
   [FIDDLER]
   url = https://<your-org-cluster>.fiddler.ai
   org_id = <your-org-account>
   auth_token = <your-auth-token>
```

# Examples:
*The goal of these notebooks is to show you how to walkthrough installation, monitoring, and model upload of Fiddler using different model frameworks and data types. You can also use these as a reference guide to upload your dataset and model along with production traffic that you want to monitor, into Fiddler.*
